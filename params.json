{"name":"AvsPmod","tagline":"An AviSynth script editor","body":"What is AviSynth?\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAviSynth is a powerful tool for video post-production.  It provides ways \r\nof editing and processing videos.  AviSynth works as a frameserver, \r\nproviding instant editing without the need for temporary files.\r\n\r\nAviSynth itself does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI), but \r\ninstead relies on a script system that allows advanced non-linear \r\nediting.  While this may at first seem tedious and unintuitive, it is \r\nremarkably powerful and is a very good way to manage projects in a \r\nprecise, consistent, and reproducible manner.  Because text-based scripts \r\nare human readable, projects are inherently self-documenting.  The \r\nscripting language is simple yet powerful, and complex filters can be \r\ncreated from basic operations to develop a sophisticated palette of \r\nuseful and unique effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is AvsP?\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nAvsP is at its core a tabbed text editor with features specific for \r\ncreating AviSynth scripts.  It has text editing features such as \r\nAviSynth-specific syntax highlighting and autocompletion to simplify the \r\ntask of writing scripts.  However, its primary advantage over other \r\neditors is its integrated video preview, which remains attached to the \r\nmain window at all times.  Comparing the visual results of several \r\ndifferent scripts is as easy as writing the scripts into several \r\ndifferent tabs and activating the video preview, switching between tabs \r\ngives instantaneous feedback on visual differences (anyone remember \r\nlining up multiple instances of VirtualDub and alt-tabbing?). \r\nFurthermore, the program offers a unique way for the user to define \r\nsliders for any number in the script, giving AviSynth a unique graphical \r\ninterface never known before.  The following are an outline of the \r\nprogram's main features:\r\n\r\n- Tabbed text editor\r\n- Avisynth-specific syntax highlighting and autocompletion\r\n- Integrated video preview for easy script comparison\r\n- Unique user-defined sliders for rapid filter setting comparison\r\n- Built-in crop editor in video preview\r\n- Bookmark any number of frames for quick access\r\n- Complete macro language using the Python programming language\r\n- Graphical front-end for command-line compression tool avs2avi\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is AvsPmod?\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe AvsP project was abandoned by its original author by late 2007. \r\nAvsPmod is an ongoing community effort to maintain and provide some \r\nenhancements to AvsP:\r\n\r\n- Importing of function definitions, including from online wiki\r\n- Improved function autocomplete\r\n- Move, rename and undo close tabs\r\n- Better Unicode support\r\n- Video preview usability improvements\r\n- YUV -> RGB options for previewing\r\n- Support for AviSynth 2.6.0 new colorspaces\r\n- Autocrop\r\n- Bookmark titles\r\n- Improved macro API with several scripts included\r\n- Native *nix support through AvxSynth\r\n- Codebase updated to Python 2.7 and wxPython 2.8\r\n- Many bug fixes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning AvsPmod\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nAviSynth (Windows) or AvxSynth (*nix) is required. When not using the AvsPmod builds, \r\ncurrently only supplied for Windows, the following is also needed:\r\n\r\n- [Python](http://python.org/) 2.6-2.7\r\n- [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/) 2.8-2.9\r\n\r\nIn that case start AvsPmod by running _avsp.py_, i.e. `python -O avsp.py`, \r\n_pythonw_ recommended on Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdating to a new version\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nTo update AvsPmod just overwrite the previous files.  Personal preferences \r\nand customizations are preserved.  However edited macro scripts and preset \r\nfiles must be backed up first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- [Development](https://github.com/avspmod/avspmod)\r\n- [Windows builds](http://www.amvhell.com/avspmod/)\r\n- [Filter database wiki](https://github.com/AvsPmod/AvsPmod/wiki/Filter-database)\r\n- [Discussion](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=153248)\r\n- [AvsP homepage](http://avisynth.org/qwerpoi/)\r\n- [AviSynth wiki](http://avisynth.org/mediawiki/Main_Page)\r\n- [AvxSynth wiki](https://github.com/avxsynth/avxsynth/wiki)\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n<sub>AviSynth description extracted from the AviSynth wiki \r\n([CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/))</sub>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
